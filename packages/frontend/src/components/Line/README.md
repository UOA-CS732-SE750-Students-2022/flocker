# StyledDivider

A Material UI Divider that has been customised with text and sizing variants.

## Props

`orText` - _optional_

- type: `boolean`
- default: `false`
- description: If orText is set, then the divider will render with the word "or" in the middle. By default, the divider will just be a plain line.

`size` - _optional_

- type: `'main'` | `'side'`
- description: Essentially a string enum. When set to `main`, it will be set to the size suitable for the main screen. When set to `side`, it will be small - ideal for side menu placement.
